# Face-Recognition-Based-Student-Attendance-System-in-Python-using-OpenCV-with-Tkinter-GUI-
Face recognition-based attendance system is a process of recognizing the faces of the students while taking attendance by using face bio-metrics based on high â€“ definition monitor video and other information technology. In this face recognition project, a computer system will be able to find and recognize human faces quickly and precisely in images or videos that are being captured through a webcam / a surveillance camera.
